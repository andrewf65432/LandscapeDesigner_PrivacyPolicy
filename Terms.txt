### 2.1 Data Collection
The App utilizes Apple's ARKit and depth sensing capabilities to provide augmented reality landscape design features. This includes:
- Environmental depth data
- Spatial mapping information
- Scene reconstruction data
- AR anchor points and world mapping

### 2.2 Purpose and Usage
This technical data is collected solely for:
- Enabling accurate placement of virtual landscape elements
- Maintaining persistent AR experiences
- Saving and restoring landscape design projects
- Ensuring realistic interaction between virtual objects and physical surfaces

### 2.3 Data Storage and Security
All depth sensing and spatial mapping data:
- Is stored exclusively on your local device
- Never leaves your device or gets transmitted to external servers
- Is saved only in the app's secure documents directory
- Can be deleted at any time by removing the app or its saved projects

### 2.4 Data Retention
- AR data is retained only as long as needed for your saved projects
- Data is automatically removed when you delete projects or uninstall the app
- No backups of this data are created on external servers

## 3. Camera and Device Permissions
### 3.1 Required Permissions
The App requires:
- Camera access for AR functionality
- Local storage access for saving projects
- Motion and orientation sensor access for AR tracking

### 3.2 Usage Limitations
These permissions are used exclusively for:
- Providing AR visualization features
- Saving your landscape designs
- Enabling project persistence

## 4. Data Collection and Storage
### 4.1 Local Storage
- All AR scenes and designs are stored locally on your device
- Project files contain environmental mapping data for persistence
- No user data is transmitted to external servers

### 4.2 Analytics and Diagnostics
- Basic app usage analytics may be collected
- No depth sensing or spatial mapping data is included in analytics
- Crash reports contain no environmental or depth data

## 5. Third-Party Access
- No depth sensing or spatial mapping data is shared with third parties
- No environmental data is used for advertising or tracking
- All AR functionality processes happen exclusively on-device

## 6. User Rights and Control
You have the right to:
- Delete any or all saved projects
- Remove all stored AR data by uninstalling the app
